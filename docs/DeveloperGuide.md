### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Switch book feature
### Implementation

MyCelia supports two operating modes: the Company Book and the Delivery Book.
This feature is facilitated by a mode flag stored in the Model component through Model#getCompanyPackage() and Model#setCompanyPackage(boolean). The flag determines which parser and book-specific command set should be active at a given time.

At the user level, the command used is switch. In the Company Book, companycommands.SwitchCommand sets the mode flag to false, which switches the application to the Delivery Book. The User Guide also states that this same command toggles between the two books, and that the UI tabs provide an equivalent interaction.

This design allows MyCelia to reuse a single command box and window while exposing two different workflows. Instead of launching separate applications or windows, the system keeps both books in memory and changes only the active context. This keeps interaction fast and matches the product’s keyboard-first design.

Example

Step 1. The user is currently viewing the Company Book.

Step 2. The user enters switch.

Step 3. SwitchCommand#execute(Model) is called.

Step 4. The command updates the model mode flag by calling model.setCompanyPackage(false).

Step 5. The UI updates to show the Delivery Book instead.

Design considerations

Aspect: How to support two workflows in one app

Alternative 1 (current choice): Store both books in the same model and toggle the active mode with a boolean flag.
Pros: Simple control flow, easy to integrate with one shared UI shell, and low overhead when switching.
Cons: Parsers and UI logic need to consistently respect the current mode.
Alternative 2: Split the app into two separate windows or two separate applications.
Pros: Stronger separation between workflows.
Cons: Poorer user experience and more duplicated logic for shared functionality such as help, exit, and storage handling.
### Delivery creation feature
### Implementation

The delivery creation feature is implemented by deliverycommands.AddCommand. The command requires a product, company, deadline, and address, with optional tags. According to the User Guide, the user enters the command in the form add pr/PRODUCT c/COMPANY dl/DEADLINE a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]....

Internally, AddCommand does not store only a raw company name. Instead, it stores a CompanyNameContainsKeywordsPredicate and uses it during execution to search the existing Company Book for a matching company. If no matching company is found, command execution fails with a "Company not found" error. This ensures that deliveries remain linked to valid company records already present in the system.

An additional convenience built into the command is that the delivery address can default to the selected company’s address. In AddCommand#execute, when the provided address is null, the command creates the delivery using the company’s stored address instead. This reduces duplicated typing when a delivery is meant for the company’s usual address.

After the company is resolved and the final address is determined, the command constructs a Delivery object and checks model.hasDelivery(toAdd) before insertion. If the delivery is not a duplicate, it is inserted through model.addDelivery(toAdd). The model then refreshes the filtered delivery list so the new item becomes visible in the UI.

Example

Step 1. The user enters
add pr/Industrial Printer c/Acme Supplies dl/2026-03-25 14:30 a/10 Anson Road t/urgent.

Step 2. The delivery-side parser creates an AddCommand.

Step 3. AddCommand#execute(Model) searches the Company Book for Acme Supplies.

Step 4. If the company exists, the command creates a Delivery object.

Step 5. The model checks for duplicates and adds the delivery to the Delivery Book.

Step 6. The UI refreshes and shows the newly added delivery.

Design considerations

Aspect: How a delivery should reference a company

Alternative 1 (current choice): Resolve the company during command execution by searching the Company Book.
Pros: Keeps delivery creation consistent with existing company records and avoids orphan deliveries.
Cons: Command execution depends on the company already existing and on matching by name.
Alternative 2: Allow free-form company names in deliveries without validation.
Pros: Faster to implement and more permissive.
Cons: Inconsistent data, duplicate company names, and weaker linkage between the two books.
### Delivery status feature (mark / unmark)
### Implementation

MyCelia represents delivery completion using a tag-based approach rather than a separate boolean field. Specifically, MarkCommand adds the tag "delivered" to the selected delivery, while UnmarkCommand removes that tag. The User Guide is aligned with this implementation and explicitly states that delivered entries will display a delivered tag in the Delivery Book view.

Both commands operate on the filtered delivery list, not directly on the full underlying storage list. Each command first retrieves model.getFilteredDeliveryList(), validates that the provided index is within range, then reconstructs a new Delivery object using the old delivery’s product, company, deadline, and address, but with an updated tag set. The replacement is applied using model.setDelivery(oldDelivery, newDelivery).

This immutable-replacement style avoids mutating an existing Delivery object in place. It keeps command behavior more predictable and fits the same edit pattern used elsewhere in AB3-style projects, where updated domain objects are typically recreated and then replaced in the model.

Example

Step 1. The user enters mark 1.

Step 2. MarkCommand retrieves the first delivery from model.getFilteredDeliveryList().

Step 3. The command copies its existing tags into a new set.

Step 4. The command adds the tag delivered.

Step 5. A new Delivery object is created and replaces the old one through model.setDelivery(...).

Step 6. The UI refreshes and the delivery is shown with the delivered tag.

The unmark command follows the same flow, except that it removes the delivered tag instead of adding it.

Design considerations

Aspect: How to represent delivery completion

Alternative 1 (current choice): Use the existing tag system and reserve the tag delivered to indicate completion.
Pros: Reuses existing infrastructure and keeps the data model simple.
Cons: Completion is encoded implicitly through a special tag rather than a dedicated status field.
Alternative 2: Add a dedicated boolean or enum status field to Delivery.
Pros: Clearer semantics and easier extension to multiple statuses such as pending/in transit/delivered.
Cons: Requires more model, parser, and storage changes.
### Delivery sorting feature
### Implementation

The sort feature is implemented by deliverycommands.SortCommand. In the user-facing command format, the user specifies a company using sort c/COMPANY. The command is described in the User Guide as sorting that company’s deliveries by deadline, with the earliest deadline shown first.

During execution, SortCommand extracts the company name and builds a predicate that matches deliveries whose company name equals that input case-insensitively. It first checks whether the Delivery Book contains at least one matching delivery. If no matching delivery exists, the command fails with an error message. Otherwise, it calls model.sortDeliveriesByDeadline(matchesCompany) and then narrows the filtered list to the same predicate using model.updateFilteredDeliveryList(matchesCompany).

The actual ordering logic is centralized in ModelManager using DELIVERY_DEADLINE_COMPARATOR. This comparator sorts first by deadline, then by company name, and finally by product name. Centralizing the comparator in the model keeps command logic concise and ensures that delivery ordering rules remain consistent.

Example

Step 1. The user enters sort c/Acme Supplies.

Step 2. SortCommand constructs a predicate matching deliveries linked to Acme Supplies.

Step 3. The command checks whether any matching deliveries exist.

Step 4. The model sorts matching deliveries using the deadline comparator.

Step 5. The filtered delivery list is updated to show only deliveries for Acme Supplies, now ordered by earliest deadline first.

Design considerations

Aspect: Where sorting logic should live

Alternative 1 (current choice): Keep sorting orchestration in the command, but store the comparator in the model.
Pros: Separates “when to sort” from “how to sort”, improving maintainability.
Cons: Sorting behavior is split across two classes.
Alternative 2: Perform all sorting directly inside SortCommand.
Pros: Fewer moving parts.
Cons: Weaker separation of concerns and harder reuse if more commands later need the same ordering rule.
### Delivery parser routing
### Implementation

MyCelia uses book-specific parsers so that commands can be interpreted according to the currently active workflow. On the delivery side, DeliveryBookParser maps the command word to delivery-specific commands such as AddCommand, EditCommand, DeleteCommand, FindCommand, MarkCommand, UnmarkCommand, SortCommand, and delivery-side SwitchCommand. It also handles shared commands such as help and exit.

This design is a natural fit for a dual-book application. Even though both books share several command words such as add, edit, delete, find, and clear, the meaning of those commands differs depending on whether the user is managing companies or deliveries. Parser separation avoids overloading one parser with too many mode-dependent branches.

Design considerations

Aspect: How to parse commands in a dual-book app

Alternative 1 (current choice): Use separate parsers for different books.
Pros: Cleaner command routing and easier extension of each workflow independently.
Cons: Some duplicated command-word handling structure across parsers.
Alternative 2: Use one global parser containing all command variants.
Pros: Single parsing entry point.
Cons: Harder to maintain because many command words are reused across books.

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
